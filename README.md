Video Recommendation System
This project implements a video recommendation system that suggests personalized videos based on user preferences and engagement patterns. The system utilizes a combination of content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and cold-start mechanisms to generate recommendations. The application is built using Flask and leverages data from various APIs to fetch user interactions and video metadata.

Objective
The objective of this project is to design a recommendation algorithm that can provide personalized video suggestions by leveraging user interaction data and video metadata obtained through APIs. The system handles the cold-start problem and provides recommendations based on user mood, interactions, and preferences.

Technologies Used
Python: For the backend logic.
Flask: For creating the API endpoints.
Pandas: For data processing and manipulation.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVD, cosine similarity).
Numpy: For mathematical operations and data manipulation.
Features
Content-based Filtering: Recommends videos based on the user's past interactions (viewed, liked, rated, inspired).
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends videos based on similarities between users.
Cold Start Solution: Recommends videos based on user mood when there's no prior interaction history.
Hybrid Model: Combines content-based, collaborative filtering, and cold-start methods for improved recommendation accuracy.
API Endpoints:
/feed?username=<username>&category_id=<category_id>&mood=<user_mood>: Recommends videos based on user preferences, category, and mood.
/feed?username=<username>&category_id=<category_id>: Recommends videos based on user preferences and category.
/feed?username=<username>: Recommends videos based on user preferences only.
